
Test file upload errors (spaces, etc.)

DEFINITION FILE

*Upload file error: Please select a file (definition-file).

*If parameter name starts with a number: error 'Invalid characters in parameter' (be more precise?). -->

*Only 1 distinct parameter(s), (at least 2 are required)

*If two parameters (only) and same name: 'Only 1 distinct parameter(s), (at least 2 are required)' said twice; should not be shown at all (already saying 'Duplicate parameter name..')

*If headers up to Value.4, but one param with 5 values: 'Value.5. Unexpected value in header ''. '.

* Same as above if missing header in the middle or if header is not 'Value.n' in column n+1 [in both cases, should say say 'Header in column A should be 'Name', column B should be 'Value.1' etc]

* Same behavior for 'Name' 

* Errors in your file: (invalid parameters) --> invalid parameter names?

* Blank row: "Row 3: Parameter name cannot be blank; Invalid characters in parameter ''; Only 0 valid value(s) for parameter (at least 2 are required)."

* Missing value: say 'parameter <parametername>, Value.n ...' instead of  '<parametername>, Value.n ...'

LOG in twice with same acccount (e.g., different browsers)

pdt_analytics.md: ctree not ok because we should put cart (unless we change meta params...)


"If you open a duplicate session window while generation is "in progress" and go to the older window, the superceded message shows up, but the progress banner runs forever." [try all sorts of duplication of sessions (during execution, not - with url or not, definition/initialexp/genx page, use 9 x 5 space), from different/same browser]


Deletion of session that is being used... (e.g. in open window; delete from another; then back to first window and execute design; or execute design (long and time consuming), then close, then dashboard and delete-- inform that is happening, then operate a cancel, else zombie processes)


open session in win a go to gen 1, then same in win b; a can't click around anymore-- ok, but should say something (Ã—Sorry! This session has been superceded by a more recent one. Please go to that window to continue.) --> maybe related to last crazy bug?


PRICING FUNCTION: develop function that calculate price of executing a design of n experiments on v parameters. Polynomial (linear) in n, piece-wise linear(polynomial)-polynomial in v; polynomial powers and singularity value v_0 are parameters (v_0 from jump limits?). Academic rescaling. Stepwise approximations. Draw curve.-- CHARGE when uploading responses.



A) Start new session
	a)Same browser
		1) Different tabs
			Open 2 windows: 
				*Complete 2nd winClicking on button of 1st window says "Sorry! 
				This session has been superceded by a more recent one. Please go to that window to continue." OK
				*

stay idle on page for long --> disconnect?

HOT: Name : 12 --> Invalid characters in parameter '12' not invalid characters (param12 works). Also, maybe flag number only with red


Try 9 x 5: generation 1 takes a lot longer than generation 2: WHY? Looks like loading the space takes 5 minutes prior to the generation of generation 1.

Purchase credit - click opens a new page (so the pdt view stays open)
Change payment processor so it doesn't require pop-up management

If disconnected from server error always happens after 'reload' on same error, how to get out?

Question marks: all same size (?), all to the right of the text they refer to (not new line)

Go directly to Experiments tab at opening

too much text (redirect to ? or readmore)


Wrong pw: return in red or bold or contextual window

Demo: first page --? what to do in bold

Donwload table same style as download template (right now, blue buttons, gray buttons)

Error: details should be larger

Not clear how to enter extra experiments

blue message wait until your session is started when clicking on existing session

You may view the list of your hidden sessions by clicking 'Show hidden sessions' (button doesn't exist if there are no hidden sessions)
 
PDT's power/validation:  DoE lines are most likely wrong (worse than the right ones). Not good that we have
2 out of 100, 5 out of 100. Add material/process variables.



hillclimb max from largest objects; introduce function; note consider that should multiply by number of iter
